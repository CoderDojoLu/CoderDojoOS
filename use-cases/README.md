Use Cases
=========

The CoderDojoOS can be used in several situations.
To enable a fast update with respect to the situations,
this folder contains folders with a configuration for each
possible use-case.

Special use-cases are

- default
- local

The default use-case
--------------------

The default use-case is the one you should look for if you want to
adapt your computer to your needs.
It contains all config files and you can copy them and override
the default parameters or add new ones.
The default use-case is sourced first, so you can access the variables in it.

The local use-case
------------------

Some computers may have a special local configuration.
This configuration "local" is reserved
in case you would like to make local changes.
