App Inventor Starter
====================

if you program App Inventor and you do not have an Android phone,
you can use the App Inventor Starter software - an Android emulator
which starts the App Inventor Companion App.
This way, you can program App Inventor without Smartphone on your computer.

This package installs the App Inventor Starter and adds a `aiStarter` to
the start menu.
